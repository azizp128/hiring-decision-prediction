    This project aims to enhance HR decision-making by predicting candidate suitability for shortlisting and final hiring using machine learning. Leveraging a simulated recruitment dataset of 1,500 candidates, the model analyzes features such as education, experience, test scores, and recruitment strategies.

    Two predictive models were developed:
    - **Pre-Interview Model (Decision Tree)**: Screens candidates early with an F1-score of 0.814.
    - **Post-Interview Model (XGBoost)**: Assists final decisions with an F1-score of 0.900.

    Key engineered features and SHAP-based explainability improve transparency and fairness. The solution reduces manual screening time, minimizes cost per hire, and increases hiring qualityâ€”streamlined through a deployed Streamlit app for real-time use by recruiters.
